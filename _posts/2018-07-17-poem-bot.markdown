I built [@p0em_bot][3] using the [poemist "Random Poem" API][1]!

Right now it only tweets poems that are written in English and that have a stanza structure that allows for them to easily be broken up into Twitter threads. I'm working on adding ways to intelligently format different types of poems.

The source code for the poem bot is available [here][2]!
