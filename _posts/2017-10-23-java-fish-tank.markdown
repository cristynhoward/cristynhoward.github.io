Inspired by a school project, I developed an object-oriented fish tank animation project.

There are many assorted Java classes for different species of ASCII fish, each with it's own unique appearance and behaviour.

    </div>

    <div class="toright">

        <figcaption class="caption">Bass Species</figcaption>
    </div>
</div>

They mostly just swim around. There wasn't a huge point to this project, other than practise working in Java and make something cute to look at.

I should note that, despite being inspired by a school project, all of the code for the fish tank is original.
