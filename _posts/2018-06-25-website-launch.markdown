I'm pleased to announce the rollout of my newly-redesigned personal website! 

Here I'll be able to share coding projects, writing, fun math challenges I'm working on, and pretty much anything else I get up to.

This is a static [Jekyll][1] site, hosted with [Github Pages][2].

Special thanks goes to SÃ©rgio Koppin, and all of the open source contributors who helped develop [the Indigo theme][3].
