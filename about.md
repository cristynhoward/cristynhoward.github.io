<p>My name is Cristyn Howard. I'm a Canadian and British citizen, a Software Developer, and an undergraduate studying Mathematics at the University of Toronto. I'm also a nature-lover, a patron of the arts, and a community volunteer.</p>

<p>Recently, I stepped away from the classroom and spent a full year working as a Software Developer Intern for Intuit, where I helped maintain the Canadian version of TurboTax Online, and contributed to a large-scale stack migration project.</p>

<p>As a junior engineer in the early stages of my career, I am on the lookout for future opportunities to put my skills to use. I thrive when working with teams that share my work ethic and collaborative mindset. If you think I might be a good fit for an opportunity with your organization, I encourage you to get in touch!</p>
