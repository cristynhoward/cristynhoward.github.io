<p>My name is Cristyn Howard, and I'm a Canadian citizen, an undergraduate studying statistics and computing at the University of Toronto, and a software engineer. I'm also a nature-lover, a patron of the arts, and a community volunteer.</p>

<p>I'm a strong proponent of the idea that tech is not magic, and that with some effort and the right tools, it's possible to look under the hood and learn how anything works. I put this ethos into practise each time I approach a new project in an area I'm unfamiliar with -- something I do rather often. I derive honest satisfaction from pushing the limits of my knowledge and skills, and find motivation in the feeling of accomplishment that comes from watching an idea manifest into a new tool or project.</p>

<p>As a junior engineer in the early stages of my career, I am currently on the lookout for new opportunities to put my skills to use. I thrive when working with teams who share my work ethic, collaborative mindset, and commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion in the tech community. If you think I might be a good fit for an opening on your team, I encourage you to get in touch!</p>
